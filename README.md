# squareoffdriver

The squareoffdriver flutter package allows you to quickly get your Squareoff-board connected
to your Android/iOS application.

## Features


## Additional information

Sadly SquareOff has no official protocol.

Special thanks to Gerhard Kalab, the developer of the ChessDojo App.
He revers enginered the square off protocol. His unofficial API Documentation
made this driver possible!
